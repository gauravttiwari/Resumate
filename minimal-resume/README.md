Minimalist Professional Resume Template (Static Design)

Files:
- index.html — static resume HTML
- style.css — minimal ATS-friendly styling

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use "Open with" -> browser).
2. To edit content, open `index.html` in any text editor and change the name, contact info, sections, etc.
3. Optionally serve locally with a static server (e.g., `npx http-server .` in this folder) for quick testing.

Notes:
- This is intentionally simple and ATS-friendly: no images/tables, semantic structure, and responsive CSS.
- If you'd like a PDF-ready export, I can add a small export script that uses `html2pdf.js` or a Print CSS stylesheet.
