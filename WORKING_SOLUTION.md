## 🔧 Why Gemini API Not Working

### Issue:
Your API key is valid BUT doesn't have access to any Gemini models (all return 404).

### Reason:
1. Free tier API keys often don't have model access
2. Need to enable "Generative Language API" in Google Cloud Console
3. May need billing enabled for model access

### Solutions:

#### Option A: Enable Gemini (Complex) ⚠️
```
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Enable "Generative Language API"
3. May need to add billing information
4. Wait for API propagation (can take hours)
```

#### Option B: Use Enhanced Algorithm (Simple) ✅
```
Already implemented and working!
No setup needed!
Professional output!
```
