# Sidebar Color Customization Feature

## Changes Made

1. **Added Color Picker to Resume Form**:
   - Added a new "Template Customization" section in the resume form
   - Implemented a color picker input to let users select their preferred sidebar color
   - Added CSS styles for the color picker UI

2. **Updated ModernSidebarResume Component**:
   - Modified to accept `sidebarColor` parameter from resume data
   - Applied the color using inline style for the sidebar
   - Added default color (#800000 - maroon) if no color is selected

3. **Updated Form State**:
   - Added `sidebarColor` property to the form data state
   - Set default value to #800000 (maroon)

## How It Works

1. The user fills out their resume information
2. In the "Template Customization" section at the bottom of the form, they can select a sidebar color
3. When the "Generate Resume" button is clicked, this color choice is passed to the ModernSidebarResume component
4. The ModernSidebarResume component applies this color to the sidebar using inline CSS

## Benefits

- Users can personalize their resume without affecting its ATS compatibility
- The color picker provides a visual way to select colors
- The default color ensures the resume always looks professional even without customization
- The implementation is modular and only affects the Modern Sidebar template

## Technical Implementation

- Added `sidebarColor` to form data state
- Used HTML5 color input element for the color picker
- Applied the color using React inline styles: `style={{ backgroundColor: sidebarColor }}`
- Added CSS for better color picker UX with responsive design
