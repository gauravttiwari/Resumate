# Project Update Summary

## Fixed Issues
- Fixed the "Edit" functionality by passing `resumeData` as `initialData` to the `ResumeForm` component
- Now when users click "Edit" after generating a resume, they will see their data pre-populated in the form

## Project Setup Enhancements
- Created VS Code task configurations (.vscode/tasks.json) for:
  - Installing dependencies
  - Starting client and server
  - Building client for production
- Added VS Code launch configurations (.vscode/launch.json) for debugging
- Created VS Code settings (.vscode/settings.json) for consistent code formatting

## Documentation Improvements
- Enhanced README.md with more detailed instructions
- Added section about available resume templates
- Created CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributors
- Created EXTENSIONS.md with recommended VS Code extensions
- Added .env.example file for server configuration
- Ensured server/storage directory is properly set up with .gitkeep

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding automated tests for the application
2. Implement form validation for the ResumeForm
3. Add error handling for image uploads and PDF generation
4. Consider adding a dark mode theme option
5. Add accessibility improvements for screen readers
